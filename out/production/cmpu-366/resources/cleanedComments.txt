0	this made my day
0	I love how Gohan just wants to see how Goku will fail at this!
0	Not really digging the Goku's gonna show you...
0	the funny thing is that there's actually a doctor goku
0	Gohan is kind of a dick, no wonder Goku is never around.
0	USERNAME Cross No, Gohan is kind of a dick BECAUSE Goku is never around.
0	USERNAME Nigel And so the cycle continues.
0	USERNAME Cross Plus, with Goku gone all the time, Piccolo has become Gohan's role model. Piccolo. ...PICCOLO!

0	you guys should do RFL QWOP
0	TIMESTAMP sorry had to do it.... BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONE SAW IS READY!!!
0	Gohan: And I wish I could have a better father, but we don't always get what we want do we?
0	Aw yeah, Surgeon Stimulator!! S-Simulator... Surgeon Simulator...
0	Blackjack? Steven Strange? Nah, they pale in comparison to DOCTOR GOKU!!
0	I gotta ask, is Goku British in the DBZA universe? Are Saiyans British? Was planet Vegeta Space Britain?
0	As much as I love this series, I can't watch this one. Much like Goku, I have a phobia of opening up the human body cavity and examining its contents. I liked the beginning with Gohan just being brutal as hell, but the second the bonesaw came out I had to stop. Sorry, MasakoX.
0	TIMESTAMP gygokus
0	Reads tittle Well, death count just went up.
0	Does anyone else think Goku is gonna show you seems a little forced?
0	USERNAME Moreso than Renegade For Life and Two Sayian's play did. Also noticed something odd, MasakoX seems to be throwing a lot of lisp into Goku's and Gohan's voices which isn't present in DBZA making them sound different and weird. Dunno what's up with that. Unless it's just the cause of him doing the voices for a prolonged time instead of voicing a few lines.
0	sturgeon simulator üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
0	It would be funny if Goku and vegeta played some video games together üòÇüòÇ
0	i actually agree. hope we get to see it in the future. Especially with the raging games. and/or put those along with nappa in it. and see what crazy thing they can think of.
0	Oh god, agreeing with everyone who wants see a Gohan plays. But Goku playing Surgeon Simulator was great!! xD Poor Chichi though...
0	Goku is afraid of needles :C
0	TIMESTAMP Meanwhile, a chill goes down Vegeta's spine, and he doesn't know why...
0	Is Fiery Hammers a thing? I need answers!
0	Surprised that Goku fainted in the beginning. I mean, he did plow through King Piccolo's chest when he was a kid.
0	USERNAME to be fair, I think his eyes were closed. He's probably more used to his enemies disintegrating.
0	USERNAME But King Piccolo didn't have any organs. Just fleshy bits.
0	Goku will always be the last thing you see. Including his hand now

0	USERNAME Gohan is Gonna Show You!
0	play the VR version
0	Doctor Shenron knows best xD
0	I JUST said the other day that Goku should play Surgeon Simulator! And look what he played! XD
0	Wow. That got kind of Giygas-y at the end there.

Well, sort of; I mean, the characters in the manga and anime - they're good friends, they could try playing a game together... Rip off Two Sayians Play and have Vegeatea come inm and crash the party."
0	love that gohan has more commentary now lmao
0	I LOVE the idea that whenever he isn't speaking? Gohan is just staring. Just wordlessly drilling into everything his father says. Wonder how the f*ck HE came into being.
0	USERNAME Kalman He should probably stop watching his father play video games. His brains will start leaking out of his ears soon. Also, Chi-Chi probably did most of the work.
0	Goku plays the Godfather
0	Goku and Vegeta play Street Fighter 5 should be fun.
0	Goku's the last person who should be making sense-based puns. He's also the last person I'd expect any hospital to allow to become a Surgeon. Even then, they wouldn't let him.
0	... I think I'll just live with my cough. I'm good.
0	Am I the only one who wants to see gohan play games
0	TIMESTAMP your British is showing.
0	Goku maybe you just stick to beating up people.
0	Now all we need is a Vegeta proctologist simulator then we will be pretty ace, oh also a Piccolo attorney simulator.
0	That reference doe
0	Watching this while being sick. I need dr goku
0	I think its great he got an achievement for putting the extra heart in
0	I feel like the only way this could be more hilarious was if Goku suddenly became fucking amazing at the game after he drugged himself. Gohan's reaction would be great.
0	krillin runs in sensubean!
0	Apparently if Surgeons advance far enough in their career they become Mister (or Miss/Mrs/Ms). I'm not sure why.
0	That Mafia impression though OH GOD, DON'T EAT THE LUNG GOKU GODDAMNIT
0	Oh that was amazing! I can't get enough of Goku playing games!
0	Omg i love this XD
0	How about you guys let goku play sonic Colours. there is a world made out of food there~

0	This game sucks. lol
0	Gokus gonna drill Chi Chi?
0	And that's how....wait I already made this joke with Vegeta. Darn.
0	My drill is the drill that will pierce your soul
0	i love how they make the main character, of the show of my time, a mental retard
0	Well.... at least it's not Goku from Dragon ball Evolution
0	Simpleton* there's a difference.

0	"Vegeta and Goku should try to play ""Keep Talking and Nobody explodes"" together. I think that one would be great."
0	Yes, yes, and yes
0	That could actually happen! They don't need to be in the same part of the world to play!
0	"vegeta"" ok click the button"" goku: are you sure best buddy? the button says detonate.....that sounds scary"" vegeta:.....""yes press the button right now, it'll uhhh...give you muffins!"" goku: muffin! clicks button and explodes vegeta: evil laughter goku: that wasn't very nice best buddy........."
0	who else watched this and was like its the thought that counts
0	i love the doctor who achievement.
0	"I kinda want to see a playthrough of Injustice, so Goku can then say ""Oh, hey Superman! I fought him twice... I died those times."" Same reason I want to see Vegeta play a Sonic game that has Shadow in it. I want to hear him say ""Didn't I already kill this guy?"""
0	Yes just yes.
0	This is too perfect
0	N O L I M I T S
0	I honestly expected more needley stuff.
0	I wanna know how Goku can think anyone doesn't need ribs after Raditz had previously broken so many of them. Surely his memory isn't so foggy as to forget the fight that spawned his inaugural death.
0	maybe this was before raditz? I think that these all take place at different times, some might take place in the hyperactive slime maimer, another night take place after freezer, ect.
0	I will admit i was a little hesitant to watch Goku play doctor. Next we should see how he cleans up blood in Viscera Cleanup Detail!
0	It occurs to me that Gohan is a bit of an asshole.
0	goku plays 60 seconds
0	Hi.
0	... did Goku do BETTER than Vegeta on the death counter? HOW!!?
0	His father was a great scientists.
0	"There actually used to exist a show named ""Dr.Goku's Show"" (Originaly ""el show del Dr.Goku) in the Hispanic side of youtube."
0	Yeah that's what I was gonna say lol
0	I like this video
0	that mafia impression killed me.
0	Wheres dbz abridged? You guys missed like 3 months!!
0	DATA NOT FOUND
0	Oh god... just imagine if Goku had to perform BRAIN SURGERY on Chi-Chi. ..... ....ohdeargod...
0	Imagine him performing ANY kind of surgery... Yep, never going to the hospital again.
0	How does Goku know what a millimeter is?!
0	I need a fanart of Mafia!Goku now
0	In Mexico Dr. Goku is actually a thing.
0	There is a Mexican Parody called Doctor Goku, actually.
0	Amm mm doctor goku is already a thing :/ he has a mustache Seriously im not joking xD look it up
0	Bardock will be so proud of Goku in his few mistakes in the surgery. After all, (His father was a brilliant scientist) or Surgeon xD
0	How many times were the dragon balls used for this video? That's a complete misuse of their power Goku.
0	USERNAME Looks like Shenron is gonna get another restraining order for Christmas!
0	sometimes I feel bad for Gohan....
0	"TIMESTAMP No ""well, it's time to get the dragon balls again"" joke there? ;D Disappointed."
0	USERNAME Asher It's the cell arc. There are no Dragon Balls.
0	There's actually a series called Dr. Goku. It is in Spanish, the voice acting also resembles the official latin american dub.
0	One of the best ones yet
0	I REALLY want a Gohan plays.
0	"For me, the funniest part is when Dr. Goku ""brutally murdered a patient in a mere 52.17 seconds."""
0	"TIMESTAMP ""Who know grabbing stuff would be this hard?"" Resisting urge to make joke"
0	Goku, please never perform surgery on me
0	This video proves that Chi-Chi is truly heartless ... and liverless.
0	And lifeless
0	And brainless
0	If its NS2 Combat, Goku gets to play as a class that centres around eating things :)
0	TIMESTAMP Uh-oh! Retard alert! Retard alert, class!

0	Wouldn't Goku be afraid of this game? It has needles.
0	"15 seconds in. ""nearest and dearest?"" chi chi? BULLSHIT! that spots reserved for food and everyone knows it!"
0	Goku and Vegeta, Natural Selection 2 right meow...
0	Catgeta XD
0	USERNAME Uchiha Catcatrot... seriously, Goku should play Catlateral Damage
0	USERNAME I think that their interactions with the green needles are natural selection enough.
0	this is amazing
0	Dr. Goku for the next DBZ fighting game!
0	i have that watch
0	"chi chi.....only one word........""RUN"""

0	TIMESTAMP ¬∑ You cannot grasp the true form of Doctor Goku's attack! ¬∑ 134 damage to Krillin! ¬∑ Gohan couldn't stop crying! ¬∑ Vegeta felt a little strange! ¬∑ Yamcha got hurt and collapsed...
0	how about you guys actually make the show vid instead of making this
0	USERNAME Umer It's in editing. The voice actors have nothing to do.
0	This should be easy! His father was a brilliant scientist! Also, millimeters? I forgot Goku lives in England XD
0	USERNAME Fan Well, Goku did bump on his head when he was a kid...
0	USERNAME Milimeters is the standard in Japan as well. [And possibly China, though they also have an adaptation of the Imperial System.]
0	well, it looked less than inches so i think even we would still say that, if not, then centimeters. but maybe that's just me.
0	Goku faints around blood? Strange considering he's punched through people's chests
0	Gohan, surgeons are doctors. They go through med school and they actually spend more time training before they can practice as a full fledged surgeon.
0	Who else would just rather die than have goku work on them? Not a hard question to answer lols
0	well dad will never be a good doctor. oh well
0	USERNAME Son That's why you use senzu beans
0	USERNAME for everythinh

0	USERNAME Smith VA TIMESTAMP OMFG
0	need. more. goku vids xD
0	I REALLY want to see someone animate these episode
0	could we have a gohan plays? maybe a game like mass effect, fallout new vegas or l.a noire where Gohan tries to reason with his foes...until he gets pissed off and murders everything.
0	USERNAME duczek I like this. I'd prefer L.A Noire. It could end with Chi-Chi finding out he didn't finish his studies (:
0	USERNAME duczek He didn't handle that Kolechian scum's bombing very well...Mini Metro seems more his pace.
0	USERNAME yes
0	Goku mafia impression was funny
0	USERNAME The Hobidon when was that?

0	USERNAME Man, that video was intestine...
0	USERNAME You know, it seems weird that a skeleton approves of an organ joke... Especially Sans. He's an unorganized mess. But I guess he was always Bone to be wild.
0	That puns tho!
0	I can't watch these videos I can't handle the retarded level it is over 9000
0	Oh God, he became Giygas in the end!
0	I couldn't stop laughing because the new name that Goku gave the patient means boob in Spanish. Anyway, got a new subscriber dude.
0	Love the fact that they kept the reference that goku hates needles in DBZ
0	how to kill you're wife during surgery by Goku
0	just use snezu bean

0	It's like Lui Calibre when he voiced 2 characters at the same time while playing GTA :P
0	I'm surprised Goku even knows what a lung is
0	I'm surprised he knows what a hammer is.
0	Okay... Vegeta as a Surgeon... bad idea... Goku as a Surgeon... VERY bad idea... just Saiyan.
0	Forgive me for being out of the loop on this, but is the whole premise of this series just Goku being late to the trendy video game bandwagon? >_>
0	No just him being an idiot
0	Surgical Operation failed might as well gather the 7 Dragonballs and wish the patient back to life
0	this was the first time they had to use the dragon balls to bring back Chichi
0	I swear I've watched every ggsy and rfl this is the funniest by far lolol I swear lol I mean there's funny ones by far but this was cool and funny
0	Lmao I'm speechless right now üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

0	USERNAME. Pokirby I feel like that's the kind of wish that would make the Shadow Dragons happen.
0	You could say he is the‚Ä¶ World's Strongest
0	USERNAME. Pokirby‚Äã That's about as likely as making Nappa smart or Krillin not getting owned. It might as well be impossible.
