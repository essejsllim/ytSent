# ytSent
Final Implementation of our YouTube Sentiment project. Produces labeled arff files from csv versions of scraped comments obtained from http://ytcomments.klostermann.ca/

#Purpose
This application will classify comments on YouTube videos as Positive, Negative, or Neutral, and provide an average sentiment score for the video being classified.

#Use Instructions
1.) Download this complete project from the Github repository.

2.) Open the /dist directory.

3.) Inside the dist directory is an executable JAR file named ytSent.jar. Running this will open the classifier application. 

4.) The classifier will successfully classify comments that have been scraped using the tool available at http://ytcomments.klostermann.ca/

5.) Follow the instructions given in the application to classify your YouTube comments.

6.) The classifier will display the percentage of comments that were positive, negative, and neutral. It will also produce an average sentiment score (on a scale of -1 to 1) for the complete set of comments.
