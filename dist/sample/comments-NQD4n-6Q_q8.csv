z13xht3huvbljnjkl222ulxhkmqbz1egk04,Shawn Kendrick,22 hours ago,1462650551804,"Some of the sins on this one were actually realistic, and showing depth. Pardon if I'm all over the place on sins, going off memory. The lack of blood on bodies recently shot isn't that uncommon unless the resulting wound is highly traumatic immediately interrupting large blood vessels with exposure to the outside of the body. Frank's history is a Force Recon Marine, trained in Close Quarters Battle with a variety of small arms. Even the newest graduate of SOTG CQB could make those shots in the lobby, dominant or weak hand with stock M9's much less compensated Colt .45's Wearing all that gear to the final battle scene isn't practical in any civilian vehicle. That's not a law enforcement ballistic vest, it's military spec with ceramic plates. Those vests are more cumbersome and very stiff in comparison. Imagine putting on a Hockey Goalie vest without the sleeves and then driving your car in a major city in Florida. Plus it wouldn't be exactly incognito should you pass anyone. Okay I'll give you the 12 guage fly back of the body sin, a target is more ragdollish due to physics. If the target received that amount of energy, so would the source of the energy. It's a movie. Asking if she knew his family was more an implied ""you have no frame of reference of how I feel and I don't want to talk about it."" Ask a heavy combat vet if they ever killed anyone, relate losing someone to old age to them watching their buddy die, or relate your paintball experience to combat for reference. Frank's high tolerance to pain is well documented, and the ability to mentally put aside personal pain, and discomfort is one of many characteristics of an operator in the special operations community. The affect noted by the Russian to ignore pain and trauma is pretty common under the effects of certain drugs. Several insurgent groups use them to the same effect, an insurgent being shot by a squad of people while under the effects of these drugs and still able to continue their aggressive efforts is well documented. Short of a shot hitting the ""magic triangle"" on the hitting the magic triangle, which ragdolls the body by destroying the brain stem, a human under the effects of a combination of various drugs seems to keep on coming until they bleed out enough for the brain to finally lose consciousness prior to death. Any Vet of a modern war would be somewhat familiar with the field improvised ""up armor"" on a vehicle. Although my ability to weld sucks, and you don't want me to touch your engine or even install a stereo. However I know a lot of vets who did all those things as hobbies. Growing up near train tracks, which is stated the villain and his wife met in that neighborhood, you get to know when to expect that annoying train whistle, especially around bed time. It wouldn't be uncommon for combat units to have a warrior's dinner, so I wouldn't consider it in poor taste to have a retirement thing, as long as no one on my side of the combat died. Most of society would, but most of society aren't in combat units or job fields where taking life is a norm to the job. Honestly it's one good way to slightly decompress post combat. Frank, a Recon Marine and a part of law enforcement where fire fights are highly probable, probably wouldn't be put off by the event. I'll give you the sin on Frank's improbable survival of the dock explosion, that close to an explosion accompanied by the fireball would likely result in his lungs burning up like rice paper. Again, movie, we love/hate JJ Abrams for this sort of thing. Not a member of law enforcement but I'm not sure if weapons in a locked case, obviously not involved in the crime would/could be removed from the crime scene of this particular crime without cause. You'd be surprised how many people get very cocky/arrogant and die by pausing to say something stupid/witty instead of just eliminating the threat. The loyalty by the shanty apartment dwellers is reference to them all being damaged and exiles by choice or circumstance. There are some people who are that loyal to those they have commonality, respect, and the desire to earn respect from that they will endure incredible hardship for the select few people they'd call ""friend"". Bumpo seems to embrace his quirks/lifestyle and doesn't find shame in them. He likely wouldn't have issue with his select few real friends commenting on them, and it's done in a manner I wouldn't consider disrespectful coming from a friend. This Punisher and the Daredevil's Punisher are a toss up for the best portrayals of the source character given the various differences of the Punisher mentality in various comics.",4,false,0,,,,,,

Had you actually listened to the dialogue before making smart ass comments about the scene, Castle explains that with a hot enough flame the body can't determine if something is extremely hot or cold. Shit - at least look at the Punisher comics before making some smarmy comments as they took some of this directly from the comics. And if you paid attention to the movie, Caste used that Handicap parking ticket to frame Travolta's wife for being at a hotel rather than the movies like she claimed. That gave Saint enough reason to think his wife was cheating on him with Quentin. "" Frank the tank"" - again, the comics- the guy is like 6'2"" and built like a brick shit-house in the books.

He takes a fake fire hydrant out and puts it by her car so when he steals it, no one will take the spot and raise suspicion. He then takes her car to a hotel, and parks it there to get a ticket. He removes the ticket from the windshield, and takes the car back to where she parked, her being completely oblivious to it. The guy he was torturing with a Popsicle was in on the plan, and when the ticket came in the mail, he personally made sure the boss would see that she's been getting tickets at a hotel when he thought she was going to the movies. With the earring on the bed, his suspicions were confirmed and he killed them both, only for Frank to prove that he was played right before Frank killed him.

Similarly, in the Punisher, Frank places evidence of Howard's wife having an affair with Howard's best friend; which prompts Howard to kill them both.

Oooh he so dark and scary...that he won't kill anybody no matter how evil or murderous. Green Arrow, basically the archer version of Batman. Oooooh he so dark and scary after spending 5 years on an island....that he's gotten to the point where he won't even torture people anymore. Seriously, with how dangerous Darhk is, you'd think he'd make the smart decision to kill him The Punisher (from this movie), the vengeful vigilante who will stop at nothing to avenge his family's death. Oooooh he so dark and scary....that he has to fake a torture scene, cares about two bumbos, and won't run over a little girl. What, do writers think we won't like the character if he actually just kills people without making some big fucking deal out of it? This is annoying when the characters are adapted for screen time and get changed through that, but it applies to original comic characters, like Batman and Green Arrow. Don't advertise them as dark heroes who inhabit the grey area of morality when they are so toothless that they won't kill anyone at all. They aren't dark heroes. There's no grey area there. They're just powerless Supermans with different colored costumes!!! Goddamn, and that's why I enjoyed Dawn of Justice's Batman a little more.

Those guys are incredibly evil and dangerous and he refuses to kill them. And in both cases, more people died because they were left alive. He most certainly is against killing, hence the boxing glove arrow. Hence why he refuses to kill the main villains. Batman is called the DARK Knight. It's not hypocritical to kill someone to prevent them from killing many more people. In fact, it's more hypocritical to allow them to live because then they could continue killing more people, which is not what a hero is supposed to do. Oliver let Darhk live and a bunch of prison guards and Laurel Lance was killed. Batman lets Joker live and escape all the time, and many more people die as a result. If that's not hypocritical, it sure is fucking stupid and childish. Even the childish ninja turtles weren't against killing. Every time they didn't kill Shredder it wasn't because they didn't want to. It was because they couldn't because of how much stronger he was. And given the chance, Leonardo straight up murdered the guy (later revealed that he wasn't really killed, but the point is that he didn't hesitate to kill him). The Power Rangers (most teams at least) are more willing to kill (most of their villains are killed and straight up explode). Talking turtles and rainbow spandex heroes are willing to do darker things than Batman. What the fuck does that tell you about how dark Batman actually is?",0

When performing your initial assessment the rescuer should: 1) Assess for scene safety and Body Substance Isolation. 2) Identify the Mechanism of Injury or the Nature of illness. In this case the MOI was a gunshot would or perforating trauma. 3) Request additional resources if necessary. 4) Assume C-Spine Immobilization. Which this PT may need. 5) Form a general Impression of the patient, who looks like shit. 6) Assess the patients level of Consciousness, unresponsive, which the rescuer did not do. 7) Identify the Chief complaint or any life threats. This patient appears to have suffered a massive multi-system trauma with penetrating and perforating injuries, possible spinal injury. But here's the kicker Jeremy: Step #8) Assess the Patients ABCs, Their Airway first, then the breathing by Look, Listen and Feeling with the face, eyes and ears (sometimes a stethoscope) and Taking a central pulse at the carotid artery by palpation. this rescuer assumed both B and C at the same time.

If he says something that's not a real criticism then it was meant only as comedy, that's not him failing to point out a valid flaw or problem. That's not him having a ""dumb opinion"". It's not him ""being wrong"", it's just him being funny the only exception to that is sometimes they'll sin something that they just missed in the movie, it's a rare occurrence, but as you said, he's human. Your whole ""sometimes his jokes don't land"" is completely subjective, what is funny is different from person to person, and again, the sins are not meant to point out holes, they are just there for a laugh, it's you who is getting in the way of finding them funny by taking the sins too seriously, even when a criticism points out a real flaw, that does not mean it's intended to mean it's bad, you can still like flawed movies, or the flaws themselves in a movie. Also your ""I GUARANTEE no one is telling the guys who agree with his valid criticisms of unpopular movies not to take him seriously."" Is bullshit, I watch all the videos on here despite on many occasions enjoying the movie that is being sinned, and I still don't take them seriously, because the videos are still funny, and in the comments I'll say so and discuss how I still enjoy the movie and why. So you can chew on that guarantee, because I do exactly that (For example I actually enjoyed all the star wars movies, hunger games movies, The good Dinosaur, ect... and I still found those videos funny because I don't take them seriously). Also, no, it's not ""defensive guys who take it way too seriously"", and no, we aren't on his dick. We're just trying to explain to you that you're taking this channel too seriously, like someone who starts calling a comedian racist/sexist/an asshole because they do darker comedy. No one here is calling him a prophet, stop trying to strawman peoples arguments just because you don't have an actually valid one yourself. This channel is meant for comedy, if you don't find something funny, well that's the thing about comedy, it's different for everyone. If you don't find something funny, just move on, not try and tell people ""This isn't funny"", it's pointless and ignorant. Watch these videos if you want a laugh, not a valid criticism to a movie. If you don't find it funny move on, you can't criticize comedy simply because you didn't find it funny, especially when you took it too seriously, the ""opinions"" he expresses are often exaggerated or not his at all simply for comedies sake.",2

Please tell me. I said criticism about you not finding a joke funny is pointless, because it's subjective, there is no benefit or reason to go ""This was shit and isn't funny, and anyone who thinks it was funny is a dick riding fanboy."" So stop fucking trying to bend my argument to mean something that I was obviously not saying, it's fucking infuriating, of course you can criticize them, but if you do it like a dick, you should expect people to get pissed about it, if you think how you stated your opinion was ""lighthearted"" in tone, then you have problems I'm not equipped to fix. Comedy cannot be criticized with your opinion that it isn't funny, especially when you state that opinion as fact, because someone will always find something funny, it's not constructive in any way. If you had said ""I didn't find these jokes funny"", there wouldn't have been a problem, that's just an opinion, but you tried to criticize them for you not finding it funny, which is pointless and irritating. But you had to be a dick about it and start calling anyone who disagrees a dick riding fanboy, and said all of this bullshit: ""it's also to point out flaws and problems he has"" ""Dumb opinion"" ""I GUARANTEE no one is telling the guys who agree with his valid criticisms of unpopular movies not to take him seriously"" ""Yeah some we're just arbitrary whatever. Not really jokes. Not really logic errors."" ""Sometimes his jokes don't land or he thinks there s whole when there isn't one"" These are the things I had a problem with, not your opinion, you stating that the sins are also to point out flaws and problems, which is untrue, sometimes they are, but the way you said it came across as you thought they were all supposed to point out flaws and problems, and you stated them all as facts, not opinions. Saying he has ""dumb opinions"" is also fucking stupid, cause now you're doing exactly what you were calling other people ""fanboys"" for doing, criticizing someones OPINION. Bullshiting saying that, people only bring up the fact that he isn't being serious when someone is criticizing him, and calling people fanboys for rightly defending against, not negative opinions, but you trying to state your opinion as fact and being a dick about it. His ""jokes not landing"" is subjective, you cannot count you not finding a joke funny as something they did wrong, yes comedy is free from that kind of criticism, you don't tell a comedian how they should be funny, just as you don't tell an artist how to create art. You can have the opinion that you didn't find a joke funny, you cannot state that a joke wasn't funny. So stop strawmanning my argument and claiming people are just incapable of taking a negative opinion and that people are acting like this guy is an idol and incapable of being wrong, it's just that most of us aren't assholes and know that complaining about not enjoying a joke is pointless and not constructive at all and get pissed when someone does. People aren't giving you flak for having a negative opinion. Saying ""He thinks there's a hole when there isn't one"" is only true when he accidentally skips over something but that's rare and understandable, and when that happens no one goes ""BUT THIS ISN'T SERIOUS"" when someone points out they missed something, no one does that, for example look in the comments, people have pointed out that the Parking Ticket sin was actually explained in the movie, no one is throwing a fit at them about that, so don't lie and say people are doing that, the reason you're getting flak is obviously irrelevant to that point.",0

I mean Castle has been everything from a clown to a magical zombie (a few different times) in the comics. But people have some idea of what the punisher is supposed to be. I mean look at this versus something like Punisher:Max (or at least I think it was :Max. the one where the cover art looks like Andy from the dawn of the dead remake). This starts with him dressed like an asshole in a terribly acted scene. Max starts with Castle describing his daughter dieing infront of his eyes as her intestines fell out of her stomach. Massive tonal differences. People went into a punisher film expecting what they thought the punisher should be. Personally though, I like the music and Thomas Jane so thats enough for me :D.",0
