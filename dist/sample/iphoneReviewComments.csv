I plan on keeping the phone for at least five years, if not longer. I know that sounds ridiculous to some people, but that's the way it's gotta be. :/ I'm currently an Android user and the iPhone 6 will be my first ever iPhone. What I was wondering is, will I be able to NEVER update IOS at all to stop the bugs that come with updates? I don't use my phone for too much. Music, predominately. The internet, sometimes videos, perhaps the odd Angry Birds or another game, texting and calling, alarms and emails. That's mainly it, anyway. I know that whatever I load onto my phone app-wise in the first few weeks and all the features, music and videos I have before updating is suggested will be all I will ever need. But if I don't update, will things start to break? I don't need to update the latest version of Angry Birds or whatever, but I don't want things to stop working from how I originally got the phone. If anyone can please give me any advice, I'd greatly appreciate it. Thank you. :)",0,true,1,,,,,,

Maybe because of the price and the fact that people who like to bash on iPhones say that they are just as unreliable as any other phone out there... So you can imagine I was like ""why should I pay more for the same thing"". But no, I am very satisfied with my iPhone. No problems, no glitches, etc. With my last Samsung I had it repaired under warranty 3 times, and after a few months the same problems came back again. Maybe I got the bad apple, idk... but I still had problems with my previous Android devices. Anyway, I am glad i made the switch. Honestly. For me an iPhone is perfect because of their reliability, to be sure that at any time I can switch apps with no effort/glitches, being able to do basic stuff like taking a call or looking at contacts without having to restart the damn thing (sometimes lagging even after the restart) is more important than being able to customise it in any way possible, which i wasn't doing that heavily with my previous Android devices anyway.",1

Battery is a beast, it's waterproof and with the armor casing I got for it, it fell a few times with absolutely no damage at all. Resolution is only 720p, but I really don't notice it. If you don't mind the huge size, the note 4 might be a good alternative, but I value one handed use, so it wasn't for me. And again, if size isn't a problem, the LG G4 is great. Battery is... OK, but it's quite durable, high resolution and fantastic camera. And if you're on a seriously tight budget, I'd go with the LG G2. Even today, it's still a very impressive all rounder. iPhone? It's not all that durable without a case, and battery could be much better, but it's lag free, great camera, sleek and a lot of fun to use. So weigh your options.",0

Personally I see Android as an OS for people who want to be flashy and always be unique. iOS is an OS for people who have gotten past that need to completely customize their phone and want a handset that delivers consistent performance. I see Android as a personal phone OS and iOS as a business-oriented OS (though many may disagree). If I was a traveling business man who needed two handsets, I'd have an Android (Most likely a Galaxy model) as my personal phone and an iPhone as my business phone. Apple has always been good at software optimization so to me it's more reliable in a business situation. But to say one OS is better than the other is complete nonsense. They both have their perks and their disadvantages. As always if the two would merge we could possibly see a near perfect OS. Something with Androids customizability and Apples fluidity and precision.",9,true,3,,,,,,

Had I never used an iPhone I would have been really happy with the M8 BUT I really missed the IOS ecosystem. It may not be the ideal OS for everyone but it works for me in every way I want it to. I was a heavy PC user until I bought my first Macbook Pro in 2011. I also bought the iPhone 6 128GB on the day of release. Since OS X Yosemite, IOS 8 and new features like continuity, the iPhone 6 is the phone for me. I use any phone I buy heavily for both professional and personal use. I know a lot of Android/Windows fans love the customization on their devices but after a few days with the M8 I was done with any kind of customizing. In the end the most effective and productive phone for my needs is the iPhone 6. I think everyone should try all of the popular smartphone OS's to get a feel for what each has to offer. My friends and family have slowly but surely migrated to IOS and all of us having the same ecosystem has really improved our communication, sharing, etc. My favorite things about IOS and Apple devices are their elegance, usability, features, and ecosystem.

HTC M7, M8 LG G3 Oneplus One Samsung Note 3, Note 4 Apple IPhone 5s Probably several more I've forgotten. I intentionally skipped the other Samsung galaxies because they are one of the worst examples for Android.

Hardware looks like an ugly flattened m8 combined with the iPhone 5c.

I doubt you are using it properly and just jumping to conclusions. - Nexus 5 is a good phone, but the amount of lag that is on android OS will never compare to iOS, even with, what people say 2012 specs (yeah okay, lol) it has high performance - Even i agree that Apple could of Done SO MUCH better within for 2014 with samsung moving forward, and they could improved on so so much more !

As for the skinned versions, they are capable of lags, but stock, no. I dunno when was your last time to use an Android device (or if ever for that matter) but things have changed. As for the alarm clock, so you think doing multiple step to do one simple thing is better than one step? Whatever happened to iOS's ""simplicity""? Anyhow, if you wake up earlier than the set alarm, you have go into app, turn off alarm, let the time pass, and hope that you remember to turn alarm back on. That is horseshit. On Android you just have a notification that tells you upcoming alarm, and you just dismiss it. That simple. I have done a series of comparison between the two. I even gave iPhone 6 an upper hand by letting it pit with iOS 8 vs last year's KitKat. I must say each shined in particular area, but iOS 8 is far too clunky for me in function. I almost thought of throwing that piece of crap out the windows, how crippled it was. I can see some people like you enjoy it, it is decent device from an average user's view, not great but ""it works"", so whatever. As for me, it is too limited. Felt like I lost a leg. Only things I miss are the games and apps, which I gladly admit are better than Android.",0

Quite the omission and even more disappointing that no one at least tried. Makes me wonder what else you missed or completely overlooked. Otherwise this was a very competent and fair assessment of arguably the best smartphone on the planet. Moreover, I appreciate you stating the obvious: no smartphone is perfect. No one and no thing is perfect but people like myself that prefer Apple -- which is to say us ""iSheep"" can appreciate Microsoft and Google but still prefer Apple -- because it's perfect for my life and my use. The good news for Apple owners is that Apple is still the platform all other competitors flock to. While Google's platforms and apps are more ingrained in the Android experience most everything they offer is available on iOS. Same goes for Windows Phone apps and platforms. And when you consider that Microsoft released a touch-friendly version of Office before any other platform, including their own, it's a clear indication that despite the vitriol that Apple receives it's still the default platform for the entire industry thereby making it the gold standard in the industry.

Back in the mid 90's - early 00's, Apple explained about processors in a keynote, and showed how a G3 PowerPC Processor could produce much better performance than an Intel based Pentium 4. Why? Because of the pipelines used. The PowerPC processor was slower, however it could preform tasks faster because it had fewer pipelines during manufacturing, meaning that data and tasks could be achieved a lot faster with a slower CPU. So it's nothing new, and yet Android fanboys continue to fight like little children, despite the research done into processor manufacturing. Skip ahead to the present day, and both the Tegra, Snapdragon and A8 chips both work to provide a excellent customer experience, and are virtually uncomparable, with the Tegra and Snapdragon tending to throttle down resources when under heavy use, with the A8 needing less RAM because it takes up less processing pipes to preform tasks. It's old tech, just adapted for the next generation. Carry on fighting, Fanboys. Know that it won't get you anywhere in life. ^^",4

Also note my current device has been on Android and it's a great mobile OS) review of the iPhone 6. I'm expecting one to be delivered within the next 14 days. I did a fast-track upgrade using O2's refresh plan here in the UK. I'm upgrading from a Samsung Galaxy Ace 2 so this upgrade is gonna be HUGE for me. The no expandable storage thing kinda bothers me with iPhones but even the 16GB model is far more storage than my current phone and SDCard combined have. Can't wait for it to arrive. I appreciate the freedom Android gives you and love the customisability but as an iMac user I have trust in Apple devices plus I don't have patience for all the customisation options. iOS focuses more on the apps which to me is all I really care about (along with the OSX integration).,0,false,0,,,,,,

Again Im sorry if reality offended you through my message in the blog. The truth is always more painful but don't despair... Ok, you gave a large amount of money for something that isn't working properly. It's not the end of the world. Stay positive and apple could give you salvation soon.

While I do think you make a lot of sense, there's one thing this review lacks. And that is the complete truth. There's nothing that Apple adds with its huge price tag that much less expensive phones with equally good stability (like, say, lumia, moto g or the nexus) don't provide the user. So calling it the best smartphone is not correct. Calling it one of the best is also a stretch, at best. Those who want stability and just need the phone for making calls could just as easily buy a cheaper lumia. Those who want customisation would buy an android phone. Those who have too much money lying around at home would go for this ""excellent"" phone. .. In my humble opinion.",0,false,0,,,,,,

This is one of the main advantages of Advanced LTE (next to the speed ofc). The energy loss occurs only when you have a poor signal (and well for LTE you need a good connection to several antennas around you). Bigger screen is not a sign for higher energy cost - today we have more efficient nematic crystal formulas than 7 years ago. The back light layer had also a really high evolution curve in the last years. Smaller pixels don't need as much energy to change state, so you can power more of them with the same efficiency. Lithium-Polymer is a way worse solution for smartphones than modern Li-ion. The polymer are extremely temperature-sensitive and would be damaged while the CPU load through video and games or even in winter when you place your device on a cold table (both vulnerable to high and low temperature). It can be also damaged through impacts (way easier than a Li-ion). Furthermore Apple has never restricted the possibility to change what ever you wanted inside your device. The iPhones have a modular build and very easy to handle. Yes, the guaranty would be voided in the old models (like my 3G), when you wanted to change battery, because you had to remove a sticker (there were never a ""cracking open"" - everything is build on solid screws). On newer devices this sticker is placed on the mainboard screws and the battery is completely free accessible (a battery change within max 2 min is not a big deal). As you pointed it out correctly - new batteries cost only about 7$ which is a negligible price. The overall battery life is also very satisfying - each 3 years a new battery (loss of about 30% max capacity after this time). All above are no rumors, but real observations as I work with this devices for about 8 years now.",1

Incorrect. The user is picking up a lot of crap without cleaning it out. There's nothing inherent from Jelly Bean up that causes battery life to worsen. You may be thinking iOS 7 and 8. How do I know this? I have a wifi Nexus 7. There are no carrier issues involved to cause erratic battery life. I can see in real time if an OS update is making things better or worse. As each update of Android from Jelly Bean to KitKat has progressed the battery life of this tablet has IMPROVED. And overall the OS is snappier, there is ZERO lag, no crashing or freezing. But more importantly after two full OS updates that Nexus 7 has none of the problems that are experienced with iOS devices going from iOS 6 to 8. There is no need for me to take files off the Nexus to run the update like iPhone users have to do, and the Nexus 7 does not slow down after a major OS update. Google sell advertising via our use of their services. Apple sells heavily marked up devices. Obviously one has a motivation for making your hardware run slower the longer you use it, especially as your upgrade eligibility period comes closer. Thus their OS updates are different in nature entirely. 50% of Apple's sales come from a single model and its variants. 50% of Google's sales do not come from selling devices.",0

I've had 2 Nexus phones and 2 iphones, trust me Android picks up garbage without the user knowing it. iOS is restricted and causes much less clutter in the system. The Nexus 5 in particular had a great battery at the start and complete garbage after my first year. Also, Android L is definitely the worst upgrade I've seen from Google, so many bugs and app crashes that weren't there before.",0

Which is why the ability to quickly and inexpensively change the battery is the better route for a power user. But even on that iOS restrict your options since they only sell fixed battery phones. As for clutter, the user needs to be aware of what an open system entails, it will not do all the house cleaning for you. It treats you like a grown up. Either way there are apps for this if you don't want to deal, it takes two seconds.They are very effective and you avoid Apple's babysitting. Win win. I simply use the task manager and battery manager to see where any power issues are working against me. It takes two seconds and one year after HEAVY 18 hour use where I'm multi-tasking for most of that, consuming an AVERAGE of 40GB's per month, my battery life is still excellent, my phone has ZERO lag, there is no freezing or crashing. It is still the beast it was on day one Oct. 2013 despite not being stock Android and I have not rooted. An iPhone 5/6 could not get me to the end of the day with my usage. As for Android L, Some OS updates are great out of the box, others not so much. Just ask Apple. But an experienced smartphone user waits for the kinks to be ironed out before jumping in. p.s. Apple should finally cave in and offer an Android phone. They would make billions. The money is there just for the taking. People want Google's OS and Apple's style.",0

Every designer and engineer knows, that a device, that was designed simultaneously on hardware and software end, will always be the non-plus-ultra case in the today's production. Companies spend enormous amounts to adapt their hardware to work with software created by others - this never leads to conflict free solutions and over time this sums exceeds the effort of creating an own version - especially if you have the capabilities to do it anyway. -Apple does. -Many companies that are using the free Linux services don't invest enough (by far).

Latest iPhones use 20nm processors as opposed to Android 1080p 2013 phones which used 28nm frabrication. That's why their battery lives were subpar. Also, When LTE signal is poor. Even the best phones will lose significant battery life every hour. 64-bit processors perform math at double rate. iPhone 5s and iPhone 6/6+ use motion processors separate from the main chipset. This separate motion processor controls all the sensors. All sensor load is no longer on main chipset. Therefore, you can get more battery life because motition processor uses lower power. Apple also uses custom Image processor which is more efficient than a built-in ISP offered by chipsets of Qualcomm. 1GB RAM gives better battery life as opposed to 2-3GB RAM we see in Android flagships these days or even WP flagships. Metal is designed to get 10 times more draw rates by reducing overload on OpenGL layer which also helps in more efficient gaming. All this stuff actually makes latest iPhones more efficient than older models in almost every aspect. Apple reported better battery life on 6/6+ compared to 5s or 5 even though increase in mah is not so much. This is confirmed by many reviewers as well.",2

That's a long stretch from the best PHONE though. I laugh when people say it feels good in the hand. You mean after you put that rubber cover on it to keep it from getting scratched or damaged? I don't see too many people without a case and I laugh hysterically every time someone says it feels more premium in hand. How premium does that aluminum feel inside a rubber case exactly? When the software is dumbed down to handle 720p and heavily restricted in what you can and cant do, if it didn't perform as well as it did even isheep would revolt. You guys are YET AGAIN the ONLY channel getting that kind of battery life. Everyone else is reporting the exact same battery life as the 5s. Heavy use requires 2-3 charges per day. Stop misleading consumers or give us your run time logs as proof. This phone isn't any more reliable or stable than any other phone on the market. It has plenty of flaws and glitches and most importantly the big ones will get ignored. Just like those nifty ios7 flaws got ignored (and exploited). Apple just does a good job of ensuring people keep saying good things about it, especially when they're not deserved. I ended up buying into the hype and grabbing one. After a couple of days I returned it. What a pathetic let-down. The $30 restocking fee was the best money I ever spent.",0,false,0,,,,,,

The software is very smooth, as we expect from Apple, but it is still very restrictive. Coming from Android, it would be impossible for myself (and many others) to adjust to that fact. The screen is great, if a little less ""wowing"" than the new Moto X's one. - Not only in colors, but in resolution, viewing angles etc. As for the design, it is both good and bad (solid)... As Micheal mentioned in this very video, the ""antenna strip bars"" and ""camera bump"" detract from the general design. That being said, the rest of the design is fine and seems to be ""good enough"" for Apple. I have a question for Micheal... Would you rather have the new Moto X, iPhone(s), G3 or any WP device? After doubting the quality of the new Moto X, looking and feeling it in store really changed my opinion on it. It is fast and smooth, very well built, doesn't come with much bloat, has many great features, and seems like a very well-rounded device in general. - Coming from a M7 owner.",0,false,0,,,,,,

For example, I have essentially become a casual photographer with my iPhone 5.

At least the 5s had an amazing build, was extremely easy to handle, and overall just felt like something different than Android. The 6 devices seem too much like Android phones to be worth using, and since many Android and Windows Phone devices either do a better job than the 6 at many tasks or do a comparable job for less than the 6. The camera doesn't feel as nice to shoot with as the 5s since the 5s was small and easy to carry, unlike the 6 (and the quality isn't as good as most Lumias, from what I've seen). HTC has surpassed Apple in designing aluminum smart phones in my opinion (even though I still don't like having the material on my phones), which just look and feel better (and actually make good use of the top bezel). The Moto X is a great device for those who want a smartphone that ""just works"" and offers some nice extras too.

I notice it freakin every few minutes I press the freakin home button on my retina ipad mini. I notice it every few minutes I double press the home button on this device. Of course no new operating system might be perfect at first, but even Android (I mean stock android) is very smooth even at first release of their newer iteration. My Nexus 4 that was released with Android 4.2 got 4.3 and 4.4 and they were all perfectly smooth and very fast, with of course a few small bugs that were ironed out later on. iOS is always said to be smooth as butter, always just works, etc by apple fanboys, but they are FUCKIN lying. I got brainwashed by them and switched to iOS from Android, and omg, the lag is even worse in iOS 7 and 8 than android. My nexus 4 is STILL smooth as butter and it was released in 2012.

They have more features and more things you can do to it but in truth I never used any of the features. I only used it once I got it and after that I really didn't care. And then it started to lag on me and apps crashing and I just get easily irritated with it so I went got a an iPhone 4s and never looked back on android after that. I'm sure Android has done much better since then but iPhone is just more reliable. And also with the battery life....who actually carries around an extra spare of battery and a spare of sd card with them everyday?,5

Got given a 5C last year as a work phone - tried it as a daily for a few weeks but it just wasn't up to it, so I only use it for data tethering now and the Nexus 4 soldiers on after 2 years with no issues.

He has an HTC One M8 and I have an iPhone 6. We both watched Netflix until we got to the rest center 2 hours away. I asked him how much battery he had when we got there. He told me 73%. I had 72%. Why don't you try the iPhone before you speak of it because I can tell just by your comment that you haven't. The design isn't clumsy. It is beautiful. Much better feeling that the Moto X, GS5, and the HTC One in my opinion, and I have used all of those phones. It also isn't prone to bending unless you wear skinny jeans and sit in a chair for 20 hours a day. Only 9 people out of the 10 million sold are reporting bending problems, it is just the Internet making a big deal out of it like they do everything. The screen technology is very nice. Why make a higher pixel density screen when you already get a headache from trying to see one of the pixels in a display? It simply doesn't make sense. The new OS features are pretty awesome, and I use them every day. The price is also not higher if you buy it on contract (99% of people do). And the update doesn't brick your phone. On my old iPhone 4s iOS 8 runs beautifully. So please, next time use an iPhone before you hate on it. I have experience with the HTC One, Moto X, GS4 and GS5, and the OnePlus One. They are all great, but I am still loyal to iPhone. In my opinion it is the best.",7

To me, when you are paying for the absolute best, you should be getting the absolute best. My guess is that Apples screen suppliers, LG, JDI and Sharp couldn't make a 1080p screen thin enough to fit into the available space, or at least not at a price point acceptable to Apple, so rather than making the phone thicker or more expensive to produce they decided to compromise on resolution.

They could be doing better right now, much much better - and it's been that way for a while as shown by the 5C. Apple make some great stuff, they have made some huge contributions to the tech world, they are or at least were game changes - I'm happy to have them around and hope they get back their innovation groove (I actually even think some of the software changes in iOS are going the right way) - but they don't deserve to be fawned over and need to have their faults pointed out to them. My entire point at the start of this was that Apple get a pass mark on their flagship device for things that would sink an Android flagship in a review. If you released an Android flagship in 2014 with a 720p display and an 1800mah battery, what do you think the response from reviewers would be? ""Screen's not competitive"" - ""Battery should have been bigger"" - ""Pick another phone which checks the boxes, this one doesn't cut it"" is my guess. That never happens to Apple, at worst they always get a ""It could be better, but it's still the best iPhone ever"" - which is somewhat defensible, given that it is the best iPhone ever, but it still could have been a lot better IMO - or from some reviewers ""It's basically perfect"", which is pure bullshit.

But I'll tell you my oppinion on the new iPhone, if you'll read it. I really like Apple devices, and I mostly agree with this review here. I do agree with you the overall battery experience is lacking in an iPhone due to its size(Apple could've made it a lil thicker to get more battery but oh well). And yeah, the phone is prone to bending but as far as I've heard it won't happen with every model and it won't be easy for it to just suddenly happen(not defending Apple though, it is very shameful of them that they didn't properly check that before selling it). But where I think you're wrong here is screen technology. It is not, absolutely not ""2012"" screen technology just because it's not over 400 PPI. You still won't see pixels in it as easily as you think, and the viewing angles are absolutely excelent, and color reproduction is great. That to me, is a great screen. Even if slightly just a little over 720p. And the OS features..most of the new stuff on iOS 8 depend on third party developers to get on the case, like widgets or keyboards. It's all still starting. I myself didn't expect the perfect third party integration at launch of iOS 8, and I don't think anyone should. And..the price..well..for the average price that it takes to build an iPhone, you could call it expensive, yeah, but Apple spends a huge bunch on advertising, and that takes a big role in their game. Plus, the iPhone is pretty much just as expensive as a Galaxy phone, or HTC, or the top Lumia phones. Regardless of specs, it performs just as well as those phones do. If people don't like the restrictiveness of iOS 8, that's their own thing and Android or other OS should be their choice, but just screaming iOS and Apple is shit is just not right to me. However, all things said, I do agree with you that it's wrong that ""nothing sticks to Apple"".

Now, I am quite sure the Japan Displays, LG and Sharp have all made improvements to their 720p displays in the last 2 years - no doubt they can make them smaller, cheaper and more reliable now - but I very much doubt that there is any improvement they have made between the best 720p displays they were producing in 2012 and the one in the iPhone 6 that would somehow make people go ""Wow, that's magical! So much better than the display in the (for example) HTC One X was!"" like you seem to think they will.

""The display on the iPhone 6 is none-the-less still a Very Good display, and most buyers will be happy with its performance, but it’s somewhat disappointing that Apple went for satisfactory as opposed to the best. Maybe that was done for intentional product differentiation with the iPhone 6 Plus, or perhaps to improve their margins… With a 1920x1080 display the iPhone 6 would have taken the crown…"" So even this very article agrees that the iPhone 6 should have had a 1080p display like it's big brother, like every one of it's contemporary flag ship phones - even Windows Phone. Now, if I was a betting man, I'd be placing my money on next year's iPhone 6S, having a 1080p display. The iPhone 6 Plus S, or whatever they end up calling it - it'll no doubt have QHD like many of it's competing phablets do already - not that I'd dispute that the 6 Plus in any way lacking hardware wise other than needing more RAM - it seems to be very good if you like huge phones. I'm not an Apple hater, I just think they should be called out on their continual ""hold it for the next version, people will spend more money that way!"" marketing strategy - which is not what happened in this review - it got a pass, in my opinion it should not have.

My personal phone is Android, while I am using (against my will) an iPhone 5S for work. I find the lack of freedom just plain insulting- how can iPhone users put up with it? A cheap USB stick can do something that a $700+ iPhone can't- you can drag and drop files onto it without a middleman. Going from Android to iOS is like being put in jail. But for someone who's always used iOS, the jail cell is all you've ever known, so how could you be dissatisfied if you've never known what freedom is in the first place?",4,true,6,,,,,,

I just said they last a while. But it's nice to have the option to sell it for good money if you perhaps did want the newer version. And really? I love Google, but that is a very ignorant statement. They are both fantastic devices, and really it's stupid to try to compare them since they both have totally different goals that they base everything from the ground up on. Android is more for customization and a personalized experience that also offers advanced features even hardly anyone uses them (Honestly if I have to root and flash roms to get the most out of my phone I don't find it worth it.). iPhone's offer unparalleled reliability and fluidity intheir phones. It all comes down to what your personal needs are. I used to bash the heck out of iPhone's, but then I actually used a few, and was shocked at how much more consistently smooth they are than the highest spec Android flagships.
