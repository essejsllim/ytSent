0	Blood pressure is a measure of the force of blood against artery walls. It is expressed as two numbers: (1) the upper number, systolic pressure (pronounced siss-TAWL-ick), represents the force as the heart beats and (2) the lower number, diastolic pressure (pronounced dye-as-TAWL-ick), is the force as the heart relaxes between beats.

0	TIMESTAMP soooooo cuteeeeeee..♥♥♥
0	Aww so cute! I started watching these because I am getting a little 9 week old Chihuahua and I am so happy!
0	Rosco can't answer you, he's swinging.
0	ADORABLE
0	Sweet. Just sweet.
0	This is really sad, these puppies should be out in the fucking wild where they belong.
0	USERNAME M. Wtf?!?!?! Puppies don't live in the wild idiot. Dogs are domestic animals.
0	Dogs are domestic. they have been for approximately 14,000 years.
0	Idiot much?
0	Just look at how healthy and happy that doggy is, that's bad. PETA should be here any second now.
0	USERNAME M. Dogs are domestic animals, Wolfs are there wild ancestor. It would be EXTREMELY difficult for them to survive on there own after over 3,000 years as a domestic animal 😑
0	USERNAME Nutella Emma X3 :D Wolves* not WolfsX
0	USERNAME LMAOO he was trolling, duurrrhh
0	USERNAME Teh UniLlama Maybe he wasn't.
0	"Puppies do NOT belong in the wild are freaking crazy?!?!?! they aren't like other animals they need to stay with ""FAMILY"""
0	He was joking He's making fun of PETA people
0	Aww
0	Why do people think dogs humping stuff is funny? Its disgusting
0	USERNAME if people think it funny, and you think it disgusting what does that make you? it is a natural drive but looks funny
0	USERNAME D True you like fucking dildos and any type of objects you can fit up that stank box huh? Its natural but say with a dog and another dog. A human with another human. Sex and objects is just taboo. But anyways this fucking world just needs too blow up anyways with how stupid us dumb humans have become.
0	It kinda loses the innocence so it is the least funny
0	"Cindy D What do you mean ""what does that make you?"" All I'm saying is that dogs humping things is not that funny. Its like spying on someone having sex, recording it, and laughing at it. Uhhh thats not funny at all to me"
0	Firefly spider Yay someone who agrees :) I'm a huge dog lover too
0	USERNAME uh what the fuck how is it spying on someone? they fucking do it in public you moron. dogs dont have the same mentality when it comes to sex they dont hide and shame it like humans. Its not a big deal in the animal kingdom.
0	USERNAME Read my comment again carefully 😑 You completely missed the point of what I was trying to say
0	I think it's funny
0	You are right.The inly one,who thinks about that
0	"I think its funny but at the same time, if a dog or any creature mounts a person/ other dog/cat/object, etc. It means they are prompting dominant behavior or marking your stuff as their territory. So while its hilarious, while your laughing, your dog will be taking over your things, YOU, other animals, and then they will OWN you. I remember my dog did it once to me and I thought he was ""hugging"" me or dancing because I didn't know what ""humping"" meant (I was really naive and I was 13 at the time) I read a book about dog behavior and found he was mounting me and that it was dominate behavior and I thought, ""awww, my dog OWNS me!"" I laughed after that though."
0	USERNAME. It's natural dog behaviour to indicate dominance but only when it's done to another dog. I own 3 poodles (one male is not desexed, the other male is and my female is) but none of them hump each other or any people or objects, because their pack dominance has already been determined and it's the desexed female who is boss. However when 2 other dogs (1 male and 1 female both desexed) come to stay for regular visits, my youngest desexed male (who is at the bottom of my pack) always humps each of the visiting dogs in turn to make sure they know they are lower than he is in the pack. Once he's done with his humping that's it for the rest of their visit. All natural and normal behaviour.
0	USERNAME D It might be funny for a juvenile. It's not a good habit to get your dog into. That's like trying to get your rocks off watching your dog as it humps your leg. I think it was cruel holding the dog over water too.JMO
0	USERNAME It is funny but allowing your dog to hump can lead to dominate behavior. Then your dog will rule over everything you have. Ours did.
0	USERNAME Wilson You must be responding to the wrong person. It's probably Cindy D you' meant to message. I know all about that and posted I didn't find it amusing nor, would I ever condone or allow my dogs to do it. :)
0	USERNAME Wilson ew
0	USERNAME No, you must be. I just said it promotes dominant behavior. It was funny until I learnt that. So YOU must be talking to the wrong person. Besides, ever seen a cat hump something? That looks more disgusting.
0	USERNAME You must mean Cindy D? EW right back to you! >:-U
0	IKR
0	USERNAME That's an opinion, not a fact.
0	USERNAME because it is funny
0	USERNAME sunset I think you just created a paradox.
0	USERNAME Perez good
0	USERNAME sunset It sure is.
0	its not disugsting, its just rather uncomfortable.
0	USERNAME Fregoe any other term?
0	USERNAME It's not even sexual. it's dominance.
0	USERNAME Perez When did he ever say that his opinion is fact?
0	"USERNAME. Farewell ""Why do people think dogs humping stuff is funny? Its disgusting "" "" 'IT'S' disgusting"" -It's=it 'is'. - When something 'is' something it truly is something. Water IS wet. Fire IS hot. When you're stating your opinion about something you should say (for example): ""I find this"". ""I think this is"". ""In my opinion this is"". When you say something ""is"" disgusting, you don't mean 'I think this is disgusting'. You mean 'this, by nature, is disgusting'."
0	"USERNAME Perez when i see something stupid i say to myself ""that's stupid"" in which case that person/object is stupid and stupid is an adjective..... so you is what i call stupid........ see how i use stupid? your just an irrelevant object like a spoon, we think about using you but we choose a fork instead cause its better.(not so in soup) so your opinion is invalid and stupid. your existence in this earth is not needed your just a wall infront of success. ill walk up to you punch you in the brick and say ""get out of the way you stupid wall.....you are infront of my success so you are not needed dismissed"" so your opinion does not matter of doggy sex like it or not it is cute and you are a wall.. lol jk"
0	USERNAME Orozco At first I thought you actually meant it lol Alex is probably astonished.
0	It's natural you pussy
0	USERNAME animatior,the thierioest and the fact teller Im not scared of it....its just not funny
0	USERNAME It's just because you find other things funny. And like The Animator, the theorist and the fact teller said, it's natural. I find folks falling off their bikes or skateboards funny. Does everyone find it funny? Some do, some don't. But I think it is funny.
0	Those puppies revolving around the water bowl was glorious and perfect.
0	So cute 😂😂😂😂😂😂😁😁😁😁😁😁😀😀😀😀😀😊😊😊😊☺☺☺☺☺ 😇 😇 😙 😙 😄 😄
0	Very cute video. You chose some really cute clips and showed just the right length of them to make this a fun video to watch.

0	That is so CUTE!!!!!!!!
0	it's a husky
0	What type of breed is the last dog? (I Know This Is In 2014)
0	I believe it's a Siberian husky not sure though
0	USERNAME CakeBlast Spitz family most likely A Klee kai,,Alaskan/Siberian Malamute or Alaskan/Siberian Husky. Or mix of one
0	Pomsky
0	USERNAME there's no such thing as a pomsky. It's a husky
0	USERNAME Polovinkin URL it's a pomeranian-husky, loosely called a pomsky.
0	USERNAME It's not a real thing and people need to stop making it a real thing. It's an unpredictable, backyard bred dog which is unregistered and unrecognised. The breed was popularised by people seeing small huskies (as puppies) or Alaskan Klee-Kais and falsely claiming they are pomskies. The breed was created solely from misinformation that began to circulate on social media and then backyard breeders jumped onto this trend and made them. Until they are recognised by the AKC, you are most assuredly being part of the problem that is over-breeding which is why shelters are so overcrowded and need to euthanise healthy pets.
0	USERNAME Polovinkin ooo
0	Thank you guys for telling me =D
0	USERNAME Polovinkin ok it's a husky pomeranian then :)

0	"It's instinct. They'll howl if there's reason to. That guy, however, is teaching that pup to do it early. He's making it part of their ""normal"" communication. This MAY mean little pup there will howl when he needs / wants anything. Meaning, this guy is ensuring he isn't getting any sleep. LMAO! Cute things often = STUPID IDEA!"
