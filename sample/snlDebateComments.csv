But apparently not so much. Just remember this, the more uber rich fuckers there are in an ecosystem, the less money there is in circulation for funding public services. The less money there is funding public services, the more likely it'll be that when you find your child unconscious in their cot, not breathing, with blue lips, and the ambulance takes an 40 MINS to get to your house, arriving just in time to pronounce your kid dead, you can thank these financially elite fuckers that are draining the country dry.

If he lives 10 more years, he can run again and he will win the popular vote without a single doubt because the vote of those above 40 will be less valuable as the previous generations will die off slightly and previous Bernie supporters from 18-40 will enter the 40+ age group (while still supporting his ideals) and many of the youth, which is Bernie's dominant group, will have obtained voting rights. All Bernie has to do is run again in the next or after next elections and statistics says he has a very high likelihood of winning. Let's not even ignore the fact that he's very close to one of the most popular people in the United States and Clinton is still struggling to beat him. Bernie, according to literally all polls, would easily beat any Republican candidate, while Clinton is struggling with that. So your claim is factually incorrect. Label your opinion as opinion, not straight out make up lies because you're brainwashed into supporting Hillary who doesn't even give a shit about the people, her entire platform is just scoring political points by trying to appease everyone, even changing her positions like she changes her socks (same frequency) in order to appeal to more voters, instead of actually stating her real beliefs.",0

The poorer black people voting for Clinton has nothing to do with race, other than it has a lot to do with it, but in a bad way - they usually come from poorer households thanks to America's system of racism and discrimination that has put them in the lowest of classes. What has Clinton done to earn the black vote? Nothing, she's just known. She has done a few votes, sure, but Sanders was the one who actually fought for black rights BEFORE it was politically ""cool"". Sanders has held his views for decades and fought for civil rights, especially the rights of the black community. Your remark about the young voters being white is absolutely irrelevant in the face of this, it just has everything to do with black people being fed corporate media propaganda to support Clinton. And yes, the same people will have grown up politically in 10 years. Then they will vote for Sanders in even greater numbers. Because the neoliberalism of America will have died off with the old Republican morons who are trying to drive your country into the bottom of the lake. Sanders is an authentic, genuine and honest candidate who actually cares for the poor & the middle class. Yet you dislike him. It's like you're trying very hard to vote against your own interests. I would say I'm shocked at how this can happen and what's wrong with you, but, sadly, having studied politics & psychology extensively - I can say I very well know why you're supporting her, and it makes me sick to my stomach at how dumb you and many other people can be. The ""stupid crowd"" is the one voting for Clinton, misled by the corporate-controlled & sponsored media. The stupid crowd is NOT the one that has grown up with the Internet where information is much more accessible, all sides of the story can be viewed and that generally allows you to see past what the journalists put on your TV screen. But sure, keep thinking you're the smart one, we'll just keep laughing here in Europe and see how quickly US brings itself to the shitter with its wealth inequality skyrocketing to the point where the rich control your country and your democracy is the joke of the civilized world. ""Land of the free"", more like the land of the oligarchs that control the media, state legislatures and the US Congress, where political prostitution & political bribery is legal (Citizens United says hello) and where people's interests and well-being is secondary to corporate interests, as if billions of dollars yearly in excess profits did not make them powerful enough.",0

That's what's got so many young voters eating out of his hands. He can't eliminate college tuition, NO ONE CAN! SCHOOL IS NOT FREE, ESPECIALLY NOT COLLEGE! If college could be free, that would've happened generations ago. In this economy, no college can give away education. Tuition payments are what help keep college's in business. Without them, colleges would eventually go bankrupt! If Bernie gets elected and tries that, he's the one who's going to get stuck with a bill that he can't pay and will have to tell the nation that he's going to have to break his promise for free tuitions. You can not eliminate college tuition for everyone in the country, it's financially impossible! Plus, if he gets elected, when he's sworn in, he's going to have to say that his loyalty is to the US not to Israel which will probably be hard for him to say since he's Jewish. You've got to understand, we've never had a Jewish president before. He has no experience with foreign policy, either. What's he going to do if he has to travel to other countries? Bernie wants to break Wall Street up into small banks which is not smart, either. Bernie may have nice ideas but he doesn't have the resources to make them happen. He's too much of a dreamer. Hillary is more realistic. She knows she can't eliminate college tuition but she can make tuitions more affordable and payable. She has had a lot of experience with foreign policy as well.

Look at what happens when Democrats propose moderate ideas to Republicans - they get leveled down to the point where the ""compromise"" is nearly completely Republican victory. That's poor negotiations that the Democrats have shown for years now. Very few people really expect Sanders to completely get rid of tuiton fees, the bigger hope is that they will be reduced to reasonable levels. You're also failing to realize - he's not going to make colleges and universities bankrupt, that's not the point. The point is that the government seeks better ways to subsidize higher education and provide it as a service to the people. Why should Americans pay taxes if the government provides so little in terms of services? Infrastructure is falling (and taxes don't even pay for it - instead it's the highway fund which apparently has little funding from actual budgets), higher education results in life-time debt, health care is privatized and for-profit, public transportation in America is a joke (compared to Europe, where our system is so advanced that entire countries are connected and you can easily travel all of Western and Central Europe by train) and there are so many other problems with government-provided services. If people are taxed, then the taxes should be SPENT ON GIVING BACK TO THE PEOPLE. You Americans hate taxes, and I see why, but why not make them useful instead of having them wasted in things like a military budget that exceeds all of your rivals & allies combined? I mean sure, US military is a prideful institution and it's very important for US allies, but we're not talking about cutting half the budget - there's so many smaller for-public projects that can be funded with just hundreds of millions or a few billion in some cases, projects that have enormous payback value (with each invested dollar yielding much more in benefit). The problem with your logic about college being made free generations ago if it was possible doesn't work in the US. Remember? Your country is the definition of neoliberalism, the Republicans have embraced it so hard that even your HEALTH CARE and EDUCATION institutes are JUST BUSINESSES with 100% BUSINESS INTERESTS. That's the problem. Health care made by the government for the people is cheaper, as evidenced by the European systems of combined nationalized-privatized health care providers. Many European countries have nearly flawless systems compared to the US one that forces the poor into horrible situations. The US government has a lot of say on the tuition fees and they can be made more bearable, and the government can make social programs to help fund exceptional poor students. Even if scholarships already exist - they can be expanded, too many people lose out on education and remain poor thorough generations unless they get lucky, simply because they can't afford education and any health care issues will quickly put them in devastating debt. I also disagree on your statements about allegiance to Israel. First of all, Jews do not owe allegiance to Israel. The state was artificially created after World War II, Israeli citizens are Israeli citizens, but Jews are not, by default, loyal to Israel. Sanders has also shown, through his stances and actual statements, that he is not pro-Israel. You have to think when a Jewish candidate is less loyal to Israel than a white Christian American is (like most recent Presidents that lick the butt of the Israeli state). And really? Do explain to me why Wall Street banks not being broken up is completely normal and should remain this way? I don't understand your reasoning. World-renowned economists mostly agree that Wall Street is too unregulated and dangerous for global economy. And you're saying that the current status quo is okay? You do realize Wall Street caused the global 2008 financial crisis that resulted in people all over the world suffering, just because people like you & US Government want to defend them for some unknown, inhuman reasons?

And quite frankly, I think Bernie's ideas are more out of reach than Obama's. How soon do you think he can make those ideas happen and if he does, how long do you think he can make them last? Money does not grow on trees. It's not Wall-Street that ruined the economy, it was Bush Jr. He's an example of why I don't want a republican being president, unless maybe it's Cruz. Bush Jr. ruined the economy by sinking too much money into the war on terrorism. It was his idea not Wall-Street's. He was a lazy SOB, he turned his back on the Middle East giving terrorists a wide open door into the US which lead up to 9/11. Bill Clinton had everything under control and the terrorists held at bay but then his term ended and Bush Jr. messed things up. Obama got right to work and started cleaning up the mess and he still is to this day. Bill Clinton was one of the hardest working presidents ever, he only took 28 days of vacation his entire 8 years while Bush took over 500! Hillary has seen how it's done and has had a lot of experience. She will work hard too and be lazy. Not to mention, Obama did a lot of foreign policy work, traveling to other countries to talk politics and trade. Hillary already has a head start on that as she's done a lot of that as a senator. She's prepared to do it, she's used to it. Bernie has done none of that in his experience as a senator and it will take him months to learn how it works. I'm sorry but in my opinion, Hillary is the right choice, she has the most experience to handle the job. Also as far as financial issues are concerned, my girlfriend also believes that Hillary is the better choice for president than Bernie and my girlfriend is an accountant, she knows a lot about how finance works. I'm a supporter of Hillary all the way but I did make a promise, if Bernie is the one running in the general election, then I WILL vote for him. I was a supporter of Hillary last time she was in the primary election and was disappointed when Obama beat her but I did vote for Obama in the general election.

You cannot proclaim ""yes, we can"" and ""hope & change"" while taking money from Wall Street, he essentially sold himself out, and his supporters lost all their enthusiasm - why would they waste their time working their assess off for him if it was clear he was biased towards the big banks & corporations? I don't believe Sanders will execute his ideas in full in 4 years of office, maybe not even in two terms. The point is that such massive change is impossible with the obstructionism of the US Congress. What many people hope for is that Sanders promises a full loaf of bread and does his best to deliver at least a slice, rather than Clinton, who promises a slice of bread while delivering crumbs. That analogy works well to describe this clash of ideals and ""radicalism"" comparison between the two candidates. Sanders' ""radicalism"" is good, because he will push for more and will likely manage compromise in the middle or slightly below, but that compromise will be better than what Clinton even starts with, which she will need to compromise down to the bare minimum. That's how Democrats have worked in the past years under Obama. Obama has done a lot of bad as well, I would argue, his drone program in the Middle East is causing massive surge in anti-Americanism and heavily feeds growth of terrorism. Sanders is just a nice, genuine and authentic person who would most definitely not turn into Obama's version of selling out and making bad policies, because his track record shows that he is true to his ideals, regardless of whether it's politically ""cool"" or not. Your opinion on the economy is reasonable, but, once again, you're failing to realize that I'm talking about the global 2008 financial crisis, not the war on terrorism. The 2008 crisis was directly caused by the Wall Street-fed mortgage bubble. It was 99% the fault of Wall Street and the US Government takes the 1% for not regulating them properly. Well, the blame could actually be split, but only in the way that the government refused to regulate the big banks and let them roam freely and do whatever they do. The 2008 crisis was not caused by any US President, it was caused by Wall Street. That is a widely accepted fact among economists and it's hardly debatable, there's a lot of material on this subject and I can link you some of it if you wish to (but I suggest doing the research yourself - bias always exists if I'm the one picking the sources, so it's better if you read your own sources and then I put my own in return to reach some common ground or understanding). I'm glad your accountant girlfriend has her opinion against world-renowned economists, I'm sure she knows better. Even though accountants have nothing to do with national or global economy and mainly focus on business, organisation or institution finances and fill out tax reports, so that's a bad example. OK, now I re-read the paragraph and it sounds kinda offensive, but I hope you understand my point. You cannot really compare this. Your girlfriend has her own subjective political opinions, but they are not based on economical facts. We can agree on one thing - Trump is a horrible candidate. I don't know the terrible consequences he will have for US internal affairs, but I sure as hell know that he will completely destroy American foreign policy because most European states would be very reluctant to work with him, for one (you can expect a major protest at every single European city he visits on a state visit).",0

Ever wonder how the Transcontinental Railroad was funded? In part...SOCIALISM. The leaders of both companies lobbied incessantly for government aid. Their efforts led to the Pacific Railroad Acts of 1862 and 1864, which provided several forms of assistance. Each railroad received its right-of-way along with a land grant of ten alternating sections on both sides of every mile of track (about 12,800 acres per mile); the government retained the sections in between. In addition, the companies received government bonds totaling $16,000 a mile for each twenty-mile section of track completed on the plains. For the plateau between the Rocky and Sierra Nevada Mountains the amount per mile went up to $32,000 per mile and for the mountain regions, $48,000. Oops.",2

FFS just a few weeks ago they literally called all Trump supporters, not even Trump, but the actual people watching the show, Nazis. Hillary is portrayed as prickly and opportunistic, but they rarely even touch the real issues like corruption and treason and incompetence. Bernie is, well they didnt even really make fun of him tbh. I dont know why so many people are crying about it here. I mean, they could have made him look like an incompetent buffoon, shown him as a greedy asshole trying to steal everyone's money and demonize anyone more successful then himself (which isnt hard considering his lack of private sector success). They could have pointed out his hypocrisy in blaming Trump for Trump supporters' violence, but not accepting blame for his own follower's violence. They could have laid in a bit more on how his programs are mathematically impossible and how he refuses to give details on most of his plans, wont define ""democratic socialism"" although really wants you to believe in it. I mean, youve got the most corrupt politician in all US history running against an ancient jewish muppet who wants to take all your money and increase collusion between government and industry because of all the horrible collusion between government and industry.

But i can understand why he told the protester to shut up... he was reacting as a husband defending someone saying his wife covered up murders. If the person is innocent, i can see why one get upset for being accused of murder cover ups... especially with her going to country to country representing this country, dealing with foreign, sometimes, rude and disrespectful world leaders. I'm sure Hillary has been disrespected and belittled by those leaders just because she was a woman so im sure her job was stressful... trying to prove her worthiness as a woman as well as representing the US well, following in the shoes of her husband who was president and some of those leaders dealt with Bill. I may be taking this too far, but it is possible that she received all sorta stress from every angle... both of them. So yes, I can see why he would blow up at the protester. Is he helping things? Probably not.. but he IS human! Now, Hillary has already explained in her debates that the terrorist are the ones bragging on the websites that the attacks were due to some protest... and then they changed their stories and later said it was a terrorist attack. So THAT's where the confusion came in. The administration was getting info left and right and was forever changing which is why some things initially said was later changed. No American is ever 100% safe on foreign soil, btw... and that includes US embassies on foreign land. (10 Americans died in US embassies under Bush) Regarding Bill's comments about the Crime Law: Bill specifically talking about the drug dealers, and the dealers preying on other young kids to get them to become dealers for them. He specifically said that in that same meeting that you just quoted. Even mentioned about (predators) targeting young females... getting them on drugs, etc... So THAT is what he was talking about when he said the protesters were defending 'them'. He was specifically talking about the DRUG DEALERS! I agree with the Clinton's: SuperPredators, black/white/latinos/asian... they do need to come to HEEL I support that 100%, and I'm black! If you're gonna party and do your weed, stay home or at a party... stay off the streets and out of religious people's yards!

I like Bernie's political ideals, but I wouldn't vote for him because the chances for him to get any of his major proposals passed in congress (tax on wall street speculation, single payer healthcare and tuition free college) are extremely slim to impossible. This is a very good list of reasons to support Hillary that I found on reddit and agree completely with: 1) Her platform is broader, and she has all along had support for things like disability rights and scientific research funding as part of her platform. 2) Related, but distinct: She is more pro-science. She mentions funding scientific research all the time. This is really important to me, personally, and it's also really key to the economy. She is not anti-nuclear (like Sanders). New nuclear technologies are exciting and important for averting climate change disasters. She is not anti-GMO (though I'm honestly not sure she's better than Sanders here, who is vaguely anti-GMO, because while the technology is good, there are ethical, environmental and economic issues with its current implementation that desperately need to be addressed-- labeling doesn't really help that though). 3) She has a K-12 education plan and it is extremely important to the future of the country. 4) She's just as strong on climate change 5) (Related to #2): She has a more evidence-based approach to policy in general, favoring surrounding herself with academic experts, studying pilot projects, and starting slow. 6) The fifteen dollar minimum wage makes sense in metropolitan areas. It really does, but would be a disaster anywhere rural. Her $12 minimum wage proposal will still do quite a lot to help workers struggling in high cost of living areas without destroying the economy in low cost of living areas. 7) I want single payer eventually. It's the best policy economically, in my opinion. Now would be the worst time to make that move. I finally have good health insurance, thanks to Obama! Let Obamacare work for a while, which it is doing. Patch the remaining holes. Let the country get so comfortable with it that they couldn't imagine living without it -- like Medicare, Unemployment Insurance and Social Security. And then, when it is at no risk of being repealed and leaving millions of people worse off than they are now, THEN overhaul the system. 8) I trust her to not massively screw up. I'm not sure I trust any of the other candidates have enough experience and/or appropriate temperament to cope with an unknown disaster. 9) She evolves -- she changes. Sanders was a radical in the 60s, which means I agree with him a lot, but he has changed very little. And where he has changed, he's swept it under the rug rather than apologized genuinely or offered any reasoning. Clinton moves with the long-term trends of the country -- and this is a good thing. She's not a flip flopper; she doesn't change what she says every week. She changes slowly, measuredly, transparently. There are things on which I'm ambivalent about -- like her college plan. Ideally, some cross between her and Sander's plan would be best. Her work requirement is stupid and discriminates against students who are parents or with disabilities. It still relies on the very flawed system of parental income as a measure of ability to pay.

I like making fun of everyone, and other than that, I thought the jokes were spot on. But making fun of someone for a flaw that's not there? Not cool, yo. Sanders knows how to break up the big banks. He's introduced legislation into congress that would break them up. If that doesn't pass, he may look for authority under the Dodd-Frank act that would give him power to break up the big banks, and they would be ordered to split up into multiple smaller corporations. He also may try to do this through the treasury. The Daily News Interview ""fail"" was not a fail on his part, it was a fail on their part. Bernie explained all of this during his interview with them, but rather than ask a valid follow up question or move on, they inquired if he really believed the federal reserve had the power to break up the big banks. Even though he hadn't mentioned the federal reserve AT ALL. When he said he didn't know if the fed had that power, they made it out to seem like he had no idea what he was talking about. Of course he didn't know if the fed had that power, he never planned to do anything involving the fed in the first place! For SNL to make this out to be a flaw on Sanders' part was ignorant at best and malicious at worst. If they wanted to make fun of this, they should have had Sanders answer his correct answer, and then have the questioner ask something along the lines of ""Wait, I think you mentioned the federal reserve."" Sanders: ""No, I never-"" questioner: ""Yeah, you definitely did. Are you seriously saying the fed can break up the big banks?"" Sanders: ""I don't know, but-"" Questioner: ""A ha! See! See everyone?

Which means it was not a legit question, and later they acted like that meant Bernie does not know what he plans to do. He will reinstate The Glass Steagall Act the way any president does, which is introducing legislation on it, and showing people why it needs to be reinstated. The $15 trillion claim does not come from any analysis of anything Sanders has proposed, but from the fact that Sanders has said he‚Äôd like to see a single-payer health insurance system, and there‚Äôs a single-payer plan in congress that has been estimated to cost $15 trillion. That's not Sander's plan. His plan is explained in detail here [1] Look for ""Wait a minute, this all sounds like magic. How the heck are we going to pay for it?"" Basically Bernie will set up a system where they can control the costs of healthcare to make it cheaper. An expanded system has the added benefit of giving Medicare more negotiating power when purchasing pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Remarking on similar legislation, economist Gerald Friedman, made the follow estimate: ‚ÄúThe United States could save an estimated $592 billion annually by slashing the administrative waste associated with the private insurance industry ($476 billion) and reducing pharmaceutical prices to European levels ($116 billion)‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Over time, reduced health cost inflation over the next decade would save $1.8 trillion, making comprehensive health benefits sustainable for future generations.‚Äù He has a good plan for free college. The total tuition at public colleges and universities amounts to about $70 billion per year. [2] He would tax the top 1% and we spend way too much on our military budget. The United States defense budget is $807.4 billion. [3]. You could easily get 70 billion from that. Bernie wants to focus more on diplomacy, rather than the war mongering the U.S. has been doing.

z13jezzygwahdbjsx23wjlcrqw2tchflf,Darksido,3 weeks ago (edited),1461483939445,"I can understand why so many people dislike the way Bernie Sanders is portrayed in these sketches. When you are using exaggeration inside satire you tend to exaggerate positive and negative aspects. You exaggerate, you don't create them. Hillary Clinton is an easy target because of her less than implacable record of flip-flopping and big money/interest connections, so that's understandable. Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders's record is so clean and constant, that apparently is not enough to portray him as a grumpy, loud, old fellow (and that's quite ok, no problemo there); you are going for nonexistent ""negative aspects"". That's what people find objectionable SNL. Is not just about Sanders as their candidate or not, is about his character. He would have ran from the hoses in the 60s? Probably not since he was chained to someone else (irony). He is losing the black vote? His economical assessment/policies are vague? He would side with the Hollywood establishment because he is a jew? Please. Maybe the last one was somehow funny; again, almost everything you portray here is an echo of the crap the big media wants us to believe. So it gets ugly when you try to recreate someone with integrity like Senator Sanders the way you do, even if you think/say is a joke. There are reasonable, creative jokes, and then there are desperate measures. Get the drift? I'm pretty sure you can be a little more down to earth with your satire, instead of inventing a new Bernie Sanders.",8,false,0,,,,,,

They make her out to be so inhuman and fake. It's just so accurate. But I have to say, I'm severely disappointed. Because they always make Bernie out to be an asshole, incompetent, and submissive to Hillary. Which is the exact opposite of who Bernie is. They're supposed to be caricatures. Exaggerations. Not polar opposites of who they really are. The people behind this have an obvious bias for Hillary and it's disgusting. That, or they've been told by execs who are bought off by the Hillary campaign to make Bernie look bad. It's getting more and more obvious. I'm probably not going to watch these anymore. And I'm going to urge others not to either. We have to stand up to this bullshit. Political Comedy is best when it's focused on ridiculing those with power and money. So when there's this huge emphasis on tearing down Bernie Sanders instead of Hillary, the Republicans, or the imbecile news anchors, then the jokes aren't very funny. In fact, I only laughed like, three times watching this. As opposed to the one satirizing the first Democratic debate, which had me on the floor in tears. SNL, you aren't fooling anyone.

You don't get a lot of dislikes for an SNL video. This video getting more dislikes than likes tells you the story. 1) Larry David and Dreyfus are just pathetic. They have no clue on what's going on in this country. In the first place Seinfeld was a big hit because of Jerry, Jason (costanza) and Mike Richards. Not these two jokers in this video. Now I am thinking that this middle class sitcom has no contribution in script work. Jerry and others might have done the hard work. 2) Larry should understand...Bernie was arrested for fighting for blacks. (anti segregation). He never ran away.

Everyone wants the minimum wage raised to 15$ but when people say that they are thinking about big businesses with the mindset they can afford it but what about small businesses?? Most of the time they take a loan out to open their business and the first three years is normally paying off the money owed. How are they supposed to expand if they can't even afford to hire anyone and the small business that do have employees they pay min wage they will have to let go and downsize to make up for and also raise the cost of their products. So two things just happened more people are out of the work and inflation is setting in.

Jerry and others might have done the hard work. 2) Larry should understand...Bernie was arrested for fighting for blacks. (anti segregation). He never ran away. He was slapped by whites because he endorsed Jesse Jackson running for president. Larry Bald idiot check out the facts. 3)Dreyfus -- Only irritating character in Seinfeld. She made her fortune because of Jason and Jerry. People watched seinfeld for Jason, Jerry and Mike Richards....Dumb head Dreyfus...do you even know what the heck you were asking...check out NYtimes article on breaking up banks and why Bernie was right. If you watch CNN you will never understand what Bernie is all about. http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/07/upshot/yes-bernie-sanders-knows-something-about-breaking-up-banks.html?_r=0 Shame on you Larry and Dreyfus for coming up with this pathetic stuff. yuk...I will not be watching any seinfeld episode again.

America was attacked on 9/11 and we responded just like we did after WWII. That was the genesis of all the ongoing war in the Middle East. After the Taliban and Al Queda were neutralized we shifted our focus to other potential threats in that region so as to prevent another 9/11 event. The biggest threat; Saddam Hussein. As a matter of fact, there are several sources out there where you can find audio of many prominent Democrats in the '90's, including Hillary and Bill Clinton, speaking out about the grave threat that Saddam Hussein poses to our national security and condemning George H.W. Bush for not going further and taking out the regime in 1991. Funny how that opinion changes, huh? Nearly twice as many Americans have been killed in combat under B.O. Just look it up. 9/11 was planned under Clinton's watch. We were attacked by Al Queda three times in the '90's, one attack against a U.S. warship and spineless Bill did nothing while he was getting BJs from interns in the oval office. We even had a confirmed sighting of Bin Laden with a clean opportunity to take him out before he could attack again and slick Willie told the military to stand down. Bin Laden is on record saying that the American's response, or lack thereof, to the bodies of our soldiers being dragged in the streets of Mogadishu in 1993 inspired the 9/11 attacks and that's when planning started. 58,000 Americans were killed in Vietnam and a Democrat got us there. 120,000 in WWI under Democrat Woodrow Wilson. Over 400,000 Americans killed in WWII under two Democrat administrations. About 35,000 killed in Korea under another Democrat. Eight years of relative peace under Reagan and less than 300 total deaths in Desert Storm under George H.W. Bush. Please. Don't talk about Republican starting wars. The Democrats own wars, and institutionalized racism for that matter. Jim Crow, the KKK. Yeah, all Democrats buddy. The economy has tanked under Obama. Sorry. That's just the truth. Do you have a real job, own a business, pay taxes? Twenty trillion in debt, America's credit rating dropped, massive layoffs, 94 million people completely living off of the government, oil prices at an all time low, a record low number of oil wells operating in the Gulf of Mexico........That's all Obama. He's been in charge now for seven years. Reagan turned the economy around after two following another completely incompetent Democrat. Own it. BTW - Maybe you should get your news from sources other than Comedy Central and MTV.",0

That leaves existing legislation and regulation, and that means ONLY a specific provision of Dodd-Frank that requires the biggest banks to submit a ""living will"" that the Federal Reserve Board, NOT the President, has to determine is ""credible."" If found not credible, then the Board can force remedies that include many actions short of forcing a bank to divest it specific assest, subsidies or other financial arrangements. Anyone thinking that a bank will be ""disappeared"" by this law is simply completely ignorant of the law. Anyone thinking that any action by the Board against a bank is going to happen in months rather than years is completely ignorant as well. Anyone thinking a President can influence the process within a couple of years is truly ignorant of the law as well as the Fedearl Reserve's independence. The fact that Sanders couldn't (or wouldn't) lay this out says volumes for what he truly is and it is not pretty.

He also wants to simultaneously use the Dodd-Frank reform to push into breaking them up which may take more time but is completely possible. And who is saying these banks will be 'disappeared'? It's a call for 'breaking them up' not offing them. He's laid this out several times in detail. But people like you would rather cover your own faults by blaming them on others. You clearly haven't looked into it or have only done so with biased sources. And who do you support? Hillary who would flip-flop on everything down to her accent if it suits her? A republican? Though that word and intellectual are far from going hand in hand. Why do you think Bernie is most popular with Millennials? The generation with the greatest supply of information in human history? Why do you think the establishment is trying so hard to slander him? Just look at CNN already allocating the super delegates to Hillary to make it look like she has a bigger lead than she does. You'd have to be brainwashed by the media or vote purely based on emotion to pick Hillary over Bernie.,0

Yes, there's a lot of information out there, but most of it is agenda-driven and cherry picked to support a point of view. And when it comes to Sanders and how he intends to break up the big banks, he most certainly does not have a comprehensive plan on how to do it. His own legislation that he's introduced is a grand total of four pages long (in large font) and the relevant portion on the actual process to be implemented to break up the ""too big to fail"" banks is: ""SEC. 3. BREAKING-UP TOO BIG TO FAIL INSTITUTIONS. (a) IN GENERAL .‚ÄîNotwithstanding any other provision of law, but not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall break up entities included on the Too Big To Fail List, so that their failure would no longer cause a catastrophic effect on the United States or global economy without a taxpayer bailout. (b) CONSULTATION WITH OTHER REGULATORS .‚ÄîIn carrying out the requirement of subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury shall consult with the primary financial regulatory agency of the entity to be broken up."" And that is it. That's his whole ""comprehensive"" plan to break up the big banks. It's so vague and devoid of details that it's laughable. So keep on believing that someone like me who is about to vote in his 9th presidential election is clueless while you're so smart when you don't even know your own candidate's plans and call them ""detailed"" when they are the furthest thing from that.",0

If you re-read my previous comment you'll see two methods he has chosen to do it, both have been stated by Bernie himself. I've yet to see an argument as for how both won't work. Either could take some time for sure but a few years to fix the system versus not fixing it is no argument. Aside from that democratic socialism is exactly what America is lacking. America is far too right. The democratic party is a sham. The country's media and politicians are owned by businesses. And there are people older than you on all sides of the political spectrum. It might be difficult for someone who isn't entirely experienced with the internet to understand but the masses on the internet in places like youtube are regulated by the truth. You have youtubers like seculartalk who gain an overwhelming amount of support from his followers because what he says is nearly always right. And if he says something wrong it's the easiest thing in the world to fact check him, throw down a comment and see it get rated to the top. You still haven't directly stated who you are voting for (I'm still assuming Hillary). Presumably because this massive amount of information makes it super easy to tear holes in all of the candidates, aside from Bernie. With all of the resources at the establishments disposal they've yet to find a legitimate way to smear him. Do you know what his history shows? Rallies. Fights for people's rights. One of the relatively few votes against the Iraq war before the actual invasion. A vote against the bailout. Foresight and experience. He understands that America can't keep acting like the authority in other countries if there's to be any chance of coming to peaceful terms with them. Who else running has a better vote history than him? Or a better scope of America's problems?",0
